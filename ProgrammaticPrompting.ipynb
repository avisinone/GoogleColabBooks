            "\n",
            " One common approach is to have the values in the swapped dictionary be a list of keys from the original that had that value.\n",

            " However, the problem statement is ambiguous. Let's consider two cases:\n",
            "\n",
            " Case 1: The original dictionary has unique values. Then we can simply swap.\n",
            "\n",
            " Case 2: There are duplicate values. Then we have to aggregate.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            " But note: the problem says \"swap the keys and values\". In the case of duplicates, we cannot have duplicate keys.\n",
            "\n",
            " Therefore, we have two typical solutions:\n",
            "\n",
            " Option 1: Only swap if the values are unique. If not, we might raise an error or choose one arbitrarily? (not safe)\n",
            "\n",
            " Option 2: Collect the keys that map to the same value into a list.\n",

            " However, the problem does not specify. Let me look at common practice.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            " 2. A function that swaps and collects duplicates into lists.\n",
            "\n",
            " But the problem says \"a function\", so I have to choose one.\n",
            "\n",
            " Let me re-read: \"swap the keys and values in a dictionary\". The most straightforward interpretation is to create a new dictionary where each key is the old value and each value is the old key. And if there are duplicates, then we cannot have duplicate keys so we must lose some data? Or we must aggregate.\n",
            "\n",
            " However, without specification, I will choose the method that aggregates the keys into a list for the same value.\n",
            "\n",
            " But note: what if the original dictionary has values that are not hashable? We don't have to worry because dictionary keys must be hashable, and we are swapping so the new keys are the old values which were already used as keys? No, wait: in the original, the values can be of any type? But for the new dictionary, the keys must be hashable. So we must assume that the values are hashable.\n",
